Configurable proxy:

You call the proxy and it will reroute the request to the final server after adding 
some extra headers.

You can define different environment and associate several users for each environment.
A user allows you to define specific headers like Bearer.

You can switch between environments and users through the api.



Please modify application.conf to suit your needs.
use https at your own risk since security controls have been disabled.

TODO:
- add certificate controls for https
- add json to api
- change Exception to Either type
